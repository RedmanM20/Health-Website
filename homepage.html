            <blockquote>
                Fitness is about so much more than exercise. It’s a catalyst for positive change, and it affects
                every aspect of your life

        <p>
            Tired of being tired? Strength training can help you manage or lose weight and increase your
            metabolism to help you burn more calories. It can also increase bone density and reduce the risk
            of osteoporosis.
        </p>
        <h3 class="maroon">Get your heart rate up </h3>
        <p>
            Want to lose weight? Cardiovascular exercise burns calories and improves overall health. It can
            reduce belly fat, promote brain growth, prevent stress, and help you focus.
        </p>
        <h3 class="maroon">Relax</h3>
        <p>
            Stressed out? Stress can weaken the immune system and cause high blood pressure, fatigue,
            depression, anxiety, and even heart disease. Learn ways to manage and reduce stress.
        </p>
        <h3 class="maroon">Eat what's right for you</h3>
        <p>
            Are you really what you eat? Lose weight, gain weight, or just feel great! Maintaining a healthy
            diet is probably the most important thing you can do to promote overall health.
