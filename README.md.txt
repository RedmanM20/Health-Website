Alpha ver 0.09

--Summary--

This is a prototype website to highlight some of my HTML/CSS skills. Eventually I will add JS elements for an added layer of complexity. The website's initial purpose is to be a health oriented website promoting factual data and useful tools to help a person get to their desired physical state.

--Working links--

* Everything under Additional Resources (they function as hyperlinks to other articles I recommend)
* Home
* Healthy Diets --> Plan Your Meals
* Healthy Diets --> Count Your Calories

--Next version release-- 

* Create a working version of healthy diets main page
- Add pictures (file type tbd)
- Add motivational quotes 
- Add healthy diets table of contents for nav menu
* Create a working Why a Healthy Diet
- Add reasons why it's important to eat healthy
- Add embedded video?
* Modify CSS a bit for the general pages
